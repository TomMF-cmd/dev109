  <h1> My Artifacts </h1>
  
  <p> My first artifact is a fake resume I created. Within this assingment you were supposed to incorporate h1, ul's, li's, and a ref's to complete this assingment. It wasn't very challenging however it did take a lot of time to complete. </p>
  <p> Here is a small screenshot of what it looks like.</p>
