  <h1> About Me </h1>
<p>Hi, this is Tom Maclean-Fancey, and this is my website! Since this is my about page I'm going to answer some questions about my goals and aspirations in life.
</p>
  <p>What job do you want to have in the future?
    Funny that you ask that, currently I'm very into computers and technology so probably something related to coding and computers.
  </p>
  <p> How old are you and where were you born?
    I am currently 18 years of age and I was born in England, I moved to Washington when I was around 9 years old and I've been living here ever since.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is the end of my Q&A</p>
