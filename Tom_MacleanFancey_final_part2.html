  <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Prior to this class, I hadn’t had much experience with coding or building websites from scratch, last quarter, I took a CS class that helped with some aspects of coding.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I used the recommended template for my website, I lack creativity unless given specific instructions, so it’s hard to create something that looks good and that I like.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (e.g., the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The most challenging part of my portfolio was probably the CSS, it was hard to keep everything organized and ensure the correct sizes and positions for elements, I wanted to avoid having things out of place.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This class opened my eyes to Web Development since I didn’t know much about it before, in the past, I used "Inspect Element" but didn’t realize the displayed content was HTML now I can read most of the HTML, which is cool.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes, I would recommend students take this class seriously if they’re interested in learning coding or web development, this class isn’t too challenging, but it’s important to go at your own pace to grasp everything that is taught.</li>
  </ul>
